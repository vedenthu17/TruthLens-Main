    },
    {
      id: 'bias',
      question: 'How does Neutral Mirror detect and handle bias?',
      answer: `We employ multiple strategies to identify and mitigate bias:\n\n• Language analysis to detect emotionally charged or partisan terminology\n• Source diversity requirements for comprehensive coverage\n• Political balance scoring across different viewpoints\n• Expert review panels with diverse perspectives\n• Transparent disclosure of potential bias indicators\n\nOur goal is not to eliminate all perspective, but to clearly identify when bias may influence credibility assessment.`
    },
    {
      id: 'sources',
      question: 'What sources does Neutral Mirror use for verification?',
      answer: `Our verification process draws from multiple authoritative sources:\n\n• Government databases and official records\n• Academic institutions and peer-reviewed research\n• Established fact-checking organizations (Snopes, PolitiFact, FactCheck.org)\n• Primary source documents and interviews\n• International news agencies (Reuters, AP, BBC)\n• Expert interviews and professional analysis\n\nWe maintain a database of over 500 verified sources, regularly audited for credibility and reliability.`
    },
    {
      id: 'updates',
      question: 'How often is information updated?',
      answer: `Neutral Mirror operates on multiple update cycles:\n\n• Real-time monitoring: Continuous scanning of news sources\n• Credibility assessments: Updated within 2-4 hours of story publication\n• Source verification: Daily validation of source reliability\n• Algorithm improvements: Weekly refinements based on performance data\n• Major methodology updates: Quarterly reviews with expert panels\n\nBreaking news and rapidly evolving stories receive priority processing with updates every 30 minutes.`
    },
    {
      id: 'limitations',
      question: 'What are the limitations of automated fact-checking?',
      answer: `We acknowledge several important limitations:\n\n• Context dependency: Automated systems may miss nuanced context\n• Emerging claims: New information may not yet be verifiable\n• Opinion vs. fact: Difficulty distinguishing subjective opinions from factual claims\n• Language barriers: Reduced accuracy for non-English content\n• Source availability: Limited by accessible verification sources\n\nWe address these through human oversight, transparent uncertainty indicators, and continuous system improvements.`
    },
    {
      id: 'feedback',
      question: 'How can users provide feedback or report errors?',
      answer: `We encourage user feedback through multiple channels:\n\n• Report button on each credibility assessment\n• Detailed feedback forms for specific corrections\n• Community discussion forums for broader issues\n• Direct email contact for urgent corrections\n• Monthly user surveys for system improvements\n\nAll feedback is reviewed by our editorial team within 24 hours, with corrections implemented as needed and users notified of outcomes.`
